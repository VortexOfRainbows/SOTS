Order Of Gems (and order of "sins"): Amethyst, Ruby, Amber, Topaz, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond
The following is my development plans :D
1. After Void Anomaly is extracted through the tainted keystone, the other portal now leads to a secret area containing the Superbia Portal Base and the Suspicious Stopwatch. The room cannot be entered until it is unlocked from the inside. It is unlocked by breaking the suspicious stopwatch, which can only happen if the Void Anomaly is equipped. The blocks comprising the room appear invisible, similar to Phase Ore. It appears in the Top Right of the sky, opposite the diamond structure, and is not visited by the Archaeologist.
1a. Suspicious Stopwatch can be powered by the Chaos Conduit, breaking into Time Shards and a Broken Watch; these can be used with the Voidmage Incubator to craft a Timekeeper's Stopwatch 
1b. Hands of Time melee weapon can be found inside the structure, which freezes enemies when they are struck, including bosses (?)
2. Stellar Tempest (Tesseract Swird) (Upgrade to Digital Daito, Vorpal Knife, Abyssal Fury, Reality Shatter)
3. Refracting Crystal + Void Anomaly => Reflecting Crystal
4. Give Tesseract the ability to do a "manual mode", where tesseracts attack only when you attack, and at your cursor.

Acknowledged But Likely Delayed:
1. Earthen Plating starter house.
2. Need a mechanic for spawning a portal once a Gateway is fully powered.
3. Smart cursor doesn't work with dressers.
4. Most Void Minions do not work with whip debuffs
5. Hydro servant wont attack in multiplayer, sometimes doesn't sync, and sometimes causes erroneous behaviors such as double item speed when other players are also using servants... Seems to be fixed on reload or after messing with resummoning fake players. Might be related to IDs for FakePlayers being desynced across clients..?
6. Boss Trophies
7. FakePlayers may sometime change the select item within their update loop if itemAnimation == 0 and a hotbar button is pressed. This doesn't seem to effect anything to my knowledge... but could be an issue.
8. Tesseract Servant right click duration is not synced, which is a vanilla caused behavior (can also be observed when players use right click weapons)
9. Tesseract Servants over-sends packets when over 10 total tesseracts (Currently not possible in regular play).
10. Player Draw layers draw in the incorrect position on the minimap when part of the head and gravity is reversed.
11. Many SOTS items work inappropriately when upside down, such as Atlantis, Helios, and more... (This is probably not an important enough thing to fix)
12. Scroll wheel with challenger's ring
13. Banners to work on platforms (should be fairly easy), and to have proper tooltip text
14. Somehow fix marble biome in vibrant geode

Update Objectives:
1. Ghost Town! (Next up)	
	1. Also add Ruined Barrels that don't require keys to unlock, and sometimes contain keys themselves
	2. Fill the Rectangle with blocks and generation that is related to the AVM instead of just being in the natural underground
	3. Find out how to better integrate the idea of the place infected by evil (potentially change tile/wall types)
	4. Make sure all walls are using unsafe variants and doesn't merge with underground
2. More Bestiary entries (and visual fixes)
3. Unique Archaeologist tooltips for items (pending)
4. Starmap
5. Pitati Longbow, Spore sprayer, Vespera, and Ancient Steel bow upgrade (Polaris Bow)
6. Torch Bomb Upgrade Item
7. House Cube Accessory that can generate a temporary house
8. Upgrade to Code Corruptor: Binary Blaster (?)
9. Shimmer Item that upgrades the store for Archaeologist
10. Fish Bomb
11. Fix generation bug with Infernum and Leviathan area, potentially fix remnants compatability
12. Upgrade item to the Hydrokinetic Antennae
13. Update Elemental Amulet sprite to include modern genshin visions
14. Polaris Nerfs and Reworks... 
	1. Make bullets accelerate slower
	2. Make lasers accelerates lower
	3. Make 2nd Phase laser spam attack just shoot directly at you. Keep it simple
	4. Prevent chasis from spinning, making the laser attack purely cardinal, and thus more predictable
15. Nerf Earthen Construct spawn Threshold

---WIP List---
Abandoned village generation (make corruption take up more of the above ground area)
Ruby Gemlock to spawn loot
Vault Room to spawn loot
Vibrant Geode to spawn Wishing Star/ Shattered Dreams
Make enemies spawn in the AV and Mines
Should Wishing Star only change the gem color, or also the border?
Fix Archaeologist Shop!

---Code Refactoring Needed List---
If any other issues come up with Gilded Blade Wings trail interfering with how other mods draw players, it might be worthwhile to rework the trails. To do this, the position of the trails would be simulated in an UPDATE function instead of inside the draw functions (so multiple calls to the draw function won't break the trails).
Conduit powering code for the two portals

---Balance Needed List (by Severity)---
5. Possibly Blade Wings, Voidspace Ranger's Armor, Elemental Armor, Earthdrive, Sandstorm Pouch,
4. Soot Spewer, Earth Grinder, Guardian Greatsword, Fizzle Star,
3. Earthen Gizmo, Corpsebloom,
2. Soot Extractinator loot, Icebreaker, Plague Spitter, Wishing Star/Shattered Dreams, Fresh Greeny/Jar of Pineapple, 
1. Tesseract, Infinity Pouch + AmmoRegatherBag,

---Visual Upgrade Needed---
N/A

---Multiplayer Fixes/Testing Needed---
N/A

---Content Needed---
Look down for Abandoned Village todo and progress...
	1. Needs: Generate Ancient Steel and Chests on corridors occasionally
	2. Needs: Flesh Block clumps, which spawn on the soot... Appear more frequently as you get deeper...
		1. Should deal contact damage. Also spawns enemies on top of it.
	3. Ash particles in the air

5. Fix issue with how dreaming lamp spawned when broken. Such as the prefix and the spawn offset
6. Increase Earth Grinder tool speed
7. Vibrant Blade damage 23 -> 22, void cost 7 -> 8, max hits on ring 4 -> 3

4. Pyramid Chests will attempt to spawn at least one of each item before randomly spawning items, making it less likely that players have to farm for specific drops
5. Since Patch Leather armor is harder to obtain than Obsidian, it has received some buffs, making the defense equal and damage competitive... However, it does not buff whips, keeping Obsidian armor strong for whip users:
	1. Head: Defense 3 -> 4, Base damage of set bonus 14 -> 15, knockback 0 -> 1
	2. Chest: Defense 4 -> 6, damage bonus 10% -> 15%

3/28/23
1. Nature Conduit now creates a Glow effect on the Acedia Gateway when filled nearby

		1. Leaves a lot of text in the chat right now; for testing purposes
2. Nature Conduit now charges the player when at max dissolving elements
	1. This gives a buff: syncs in multiplayer
	2. This also has a cool visual: does NOT sync in multiplayer (simply put, buffs are extremely finicky)
		1. Since the visuals aren't particularly important for this mechanic, it works out
3. Nature Conduit now induces a small charging visual on the Acedia portal
	1. Works in multiplayer
	2. Needs to also modify the sprite!

	3. It's a bit weak in HM, but it should be useful for invasion events still due to its collateral damage.
	4. Now has some defense penetration (30 units) (to further add to utility potential)

		b. Perhaps its pulling power could be enhanced for airborne enemies? Or its slowing power?

2. TMODPORTER: Errors from 17900 down to 9100!
	1. MASSIVE PROGRESS, THANKS TMODPORTER!
	2. After some more stuff, up to 9730 errors. This is because Tmodporter would actual mess up some things in Worldgen if not done properly.
		1. About 6300+ of these are in the Worldgen Methods which I will tackle next.
3. Frigid Javelin should now no longer consume void with set bonus enabled

5/8/22
1. More porting progess. Errors down from around 40000 to around 20000!

4/18/22
1. Worked on Stellar Shot
	1. Should work in Multiplayer.
	2. This gun is quite simple, but its satisfying to use!

5. Polaris is now less intensive on Low Fidel
6. Fixed weird recipe errors
7. Cursed Gauntlet: kb 8.5 -> 7, useAnim 12 -> 24, void cost 3 -> 4

4. Chaos Chamber damage 66 -> 80
5. Reality Shatter damage 80 -> 100

3. Reworked Miner's Pickaxe
	1. Works in multiplayer

4/10/22 & 4/11/22

	1. Tested: Works in Singleplayer after Lux is killed...
	2. Tested: Works in Multiplayer after Lux kill!
	3. Now attepts to avoid other space generated structures
2. Phase Bar is more expensive to craft, along with the items that require it. 6 per bar -> 10 per bar
3. Prevent Lux from dying in desperation before collector arrives

	1. This one is still the best single target damage void weapon.
	2. It holds up quite well, and I don't think it needs much of a buff, despite the harder obtain
5. Added Hallowed Treasure Slime and Banner
	1. Shadow Treasure Slime rates 0.03 -> 0.02
		1. Was spawning way frequently
6. Added Dungeon Treasure slime
	1. This one might be too rare, idk.

8. Evil Spirit damage increased: (80, 135) -> (80, 145), second phase hp (10000, 13500 -> 10000, 14500)

2. Worked on Phase ore Spawning. so far can be manually spawned, these are just some ideas

6. Starshot Crossbow added to Rose Bow crafting

4/6/22 & 4/7/22
1. Rose Bow Finished!

	2. Should be balanced as a void weapon. Against single target, it does give or take the same as Tsunami and Phantasm (if not worse)
		1. Though it goes through walls and homes
	3. Has amazing Void to Damage ratio, doing about 8000 damage full charge with equipment against Lux. ~266.67 damage per void
2. Lux damage 110 (176) -> 100 (160)

4/4/22
1. Added Earthen Furniture tiles. Missing walls

4/3/22
1. Replaced SOTSPlayer.OrbitalCounter with SOTSWorld.GlobalCounter.
	1. This should make the orbital relating minions and other values that require the iterator more consistent in multiplayer
	2. In addition, it also lessens the amount of packets that are sent in total, making it less strenuous.
2. Reworked some logic in Void Minion and Void parameter related syncing.
	1. This *should* make void minions function better in multiplayer, as there was a massive oversight in multiplayer void minion calculations 
		(used Projectile.owner == player.whoAmI instead of Projectile.owner == Main.myPlayer)
	2. Also less intensive, as only the owner client will calculate void minion consumption, instead of all clients
		(now using Main.myPlayer == player.whoAmI, which makes it so only the client player runs the calculations)
	3. Confirmed fixed! The only error case is if the spirit owner is running behind, aka has frame skip subtle or off.
3. Fixed an oversight with Pharaoh's Shade that required the projectile to spawn on every client, instead of being synced in Multiplayer.
	1. This should fix Pharaoh's Curse turning Invisible occasionally.
	2. Also fixed a lighting oversight with Phase 2 transition which caused the mask to change colors weirdly
4. Added glowmask to Earthshaker, Miners Sword, Manic Miner
	1. Reworked manic miner to now be a linear mining tool
5. Added Tainted Keystone
	1. Part of Voidmage Incubator recipe
6. Buff growth rate for Hydroponics (1200 -> 240)
	1. Watching beta testers. Its quite expensive and it isn't as fast as I'd like it to be. 
	2. It's also important to note that it won't ever give double from a regrowth staff, like normal plants would, nor seeds for exponential growth.
7. Added Lux Treasure bag
8. Attempted bug fix on weird player freeze. Not sure if it works yet, but haven't seen the bug reoccur.

4/2/22 & 4/3/22
1. Nature Plating doors are considered housing viable!
2. Reworked void consumption internals. This fixes any weird interactions between multiple players or Subspace Servant.
	1. This seems to have better multiplayer compatability.
3. Decrease hydroponics crafting cost.
	1. May also now be crafted with any 20 alchemical seeds.
4. Pharaohs Curse low fidelity setting now works properly in Phase 2
	1. Attempted a fix on the invisibility bug. Unvarified results.

4/1/22 & 4/2/22
1. Worked on Collector Mk2
	1. Now works in Multiplayer!
2. Precarious Cluster and Dissolving brilliances decrease flat void regeneration while in inventory
3. Amber Mosquito added to Gold Treasure Slime loot pool
4. Renamed "flat void regeneration" to "void drain"

5. Lux now uses Advisor Theme (temp)
	1. Putrid Pinky music box is also craftable now
6. Lux now despawns properly
	1. Works in multiplayer
7. Lux tested in and got some fixes for Multiplayer
	1. Works almost flawlessly as far as I am concerned

3/30/22

	3. Tested: Works in multiplayer! A miracle!

3/28/22
1. Nature and Jungle Treasure slime now can drop Herb Bags 1-3

4. SOTSWorld.downed variables now sync in mulitplayer properly
5. Foggy Clairvoyance damage buff 35% -> 15%
	1. Was far too strong for how little it actually hurt you
	2. It still provides immunity to pretty much every debuff, so it will remain strong
6. Subspace Locket decreases damage by a multiplicative 25%
	1. This is obvious why I would nerf it
7. Began working on Lux death animation (VERY WIP)

3/20/22
1. Tidal construct no longer spawns in the Dungeon
2. Added recipe for Water Walking Boots (temporary, will be replaced by treasure slimes eventually)

6. More work on Voidmage Incubator (STILL WIP)
	1. Added shaders
	2. Added Void Metamorphosis
	3. Some balancing tweaks
	4. Needed: debuff: Dilation Sickness, some balancing. MULTIPLAYER SYNCNG (DOES NOT WORK AT ALL IN MULTIPLAYER)

3/18/22
1. Finished Ethereal Scepter.
	1. Damage is about 5~10% weaker single target than Xenos (and somewhat less reliable), but has far more capable multi-target
	2. Syncs in Multiplayer! :D

3/17/22 & 3/18/22
1. WIP Ethereal Scepter

3/15/22 & 3/16/22
1. Added Reality Shatter
	1. True melee. Works in Multiplayer
2. Sandstone Edge now has scale 1.0 -> 1.4
	1. Was outclassed by Imperial Pike. The extra range should help it compete with the Pike.
3. Void debuffs are incredibly punishing when using VMIncubator
4. Planetarium Sky is now incredibly dark

3/13/22 & 3/14/22
1. WIP timefreeze mechanic (VM Incubator)
	1. Potentially very laggy when killing enemies with luiAFK ultimate battler. Though this shouldn't be a big issue with most items/weapons
2. Lux max life (60000, 90000) -> (60000, 96000)
	1. Lux damage (100, 160) -> (110, 176)

	2. Syncs in Multiplayer
4. WIP Art for Collector Mk2

3/12/22
1. Added time freeze mechanic to projectiles, WORKS IN MULTIPLAYER
	1. This will remain unused for now
2. WIP Voidmage Incubator
	1. THIS IS VERY UNFINISHED. I plan to make a DIFFERENT time freeze system for this item! Also needs new buffs, debuffs, etc
3. Added Blaspha as an upgrade to Doomstick. WORKS IN MULTIPLAYER
	1. Doomstick Damage 31 -> 27
	2. Could be overpowered?? Idk 
4. Spectre Spirit Storm damage 58 -> 70, usetime 13 -> 15
	1. Used a bit too much void for what it did. This should make it more efficient and compete better with Plasma Accelerator and Blaspha which are both non-void and same tier

3/9/22 & 3/10/22
1. Lux 
	1. Thunder Column attack is far stronger, more fair hitbox
	2. Phase 2 RGB attack, Scatter bullet attack, and Hyperbeam attack all enhanced

2. Pharaoh's Curse will now dash at you from whichever side it is already closest to.

3/2/22
1. Pharaoh's Curse defense 20 -> 13
	1. Wanted to buff its defense, but felt a bit overtuned given the hp increase too
2. Bulwark of the Ancients requires Terminal Cluster
3. Bore Bullets are sold exclusively in Hardmode (still 25% chance), slow down less going through enemies (30 -> 15), and have a higher multi-hit CD (45 -> 240)
	1. Damage 9 -> 11. No longer hits enemies multiple times, slight compensation
	2. Now crafts 100 per Jury Rigged Drill (down from 200)
4. Calculator Homing Range decreased, 120 -> 96
	1. Still extremely potent - slight nerf
5. 1/4 second cooldown to onhit effects
6. Added Prickly Pear Shield. Should sync in multiplayer (not tested)
	1. A bit of a niche accessory, but should be useful when you don't have many accessory early game

2/28/22
1. Decrease Spawnrates of Evil Treasure slimes 0.075 -> 0.05
2. Made frigid bricks/wall actually craftable
3. Bone Clapper and Coconut Gun now spawn in locked chests that require the ruined key

	1. Increased randomization of Lux attacks.
2. Phase ore modifications
3. Acorn Bag hit damage 7 -> 6, cooldown 17 -> 20

3. Small Lux adjustments + telegraph

2/21/22
1. Perfect Star visual updates and Checked: syncs in multiplayer

2/9/22 & 1/10/22
1. Reorganized spirit minions buff folder/internals
2. Added Evil Spirit Staff!
	1. Syncs in Multiplayer!
3. Added hardmode bars to Transmutation Altar

2/8/22
1. Otherworld Spirit Staff damage 30 -> 25 (on full charge: 120 -> 100)
	1. Void cost 65 -> 75
	2. This one attacks through walls, does a lot of damage, and is literally viable up to Subspace Serpent, thus a nerf should be reasonable
2. Permafrost Spirit Staff damage 19 -> 17
	1. Make sure this doesn't soley overtake nerfed Earthen spirit staff
3. Added Dissolving Brilliance block and wall

2/4/22 to 2/7/22

	2. Watching Pixelated Fireball has taught me how overtuned this item is.
	3. The void minion nerfs comes this patch, but this should gain an additional nerf due to being massively better than other minion and void minion options.
6. Added Inferno Spirit Staff
	1. Syncs in multiplayer!
Boss Buffs:
7. Pharaoh's Curse defense 10 -> 20
	1. He died a little too quickly for my liking
	2. Hp (3250, 4500) -> (4000, 5000)
8. Advisor defense 22-> 24
	1. His fight should be a more notable end to p-Hardmode
	2. Hp (11000, 14500) -> (12500, 16000)
	3. Base damage (52, 83) -> (54, 86)

2/1/22
1. Gold Arc staff damage 40 -> 34
	1. Found this to be overtuned even compared to vibrant items (had double the dpv of Vibrant Cannon ON SINGLE target)
	2. Void cost 3 -> 4 (this can be easily fixed with void accessories)
2. Added Geostorm (Syncs in multiplayer)
	1. This does a lot less dpv (damage per void) compared to other on tier void items
	2. However, it can be aimed anywhere, giving it more utility (though it is a tad slow)

1/30/22 & 1/31/22
1. Lux visuals and Chaos Spirit visuals!
2. Vibrant Blade damage 15 -> 17
	1. Vibrant Blade is already strong. This is meant to differentiate it from Shattershine (which is primarily multitarget)

1/29/22
1. Added Ancient steel
2. Made vibrant bar and ancient steel placeable

	1. Damage 27 -> 33 to compensate
	2. Checked: server syncs fine!
2. Added another attack for Chaos Construct (this one is also a bit simple)
3. Also Chaos Construct gore

1/23/22
1. Attack for Chaos Construct (WIP)
2. Fixed weird glow on Plasma Ball for Inferno Construct

4. Chaos Construct drops

	1. Tried to nerf but somehow the variables aren't working when modified?
