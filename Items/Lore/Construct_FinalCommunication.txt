ADVISOR TRANSMISSION
BEGIN LOG
=============
URGENT MESSAGE TO NEXUS.
THE EXCAVATOR'S MIND MODULE HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY THE HUMANS OF THE MINING SETTLEMENT.
THIS OCCURRED IN THEIR EXPECTED YET IGNORED BETRAYAL ATTEMPT.
ALL HUMANS IN-SETTLEMENT ARE PRESUMED DECEASED.
ALL CONSTRUCTS IN SETTLEMENT ARE PRESSUMED DESTROYED.
FOREIGN PORTAL WAS OPENED PRIOR TO THIS EVENT, AND RELEASED AN UNKNOWN FOREIGN PATHOGEN WHICH HAS OVERTAKEN THE SETTLEMENT.
THE PATHOGEN IS RAPIDLY MAKING ITS WAY TOWARDS THE SURFACE.
PERMISSION TO CLOSE GATEWAY TO PREVENT FURTHER SPREAD OF PATHOGEN?
...ACESSING...
...THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I HAVE WARNED, AS PER MY DESIGN, AGAINST UNWISE AND PREMATURE ACTION FOR THOUSANDS OF CYCLES.
AND I AM EXPECTED TO NOT ONLY KEEP THE GATEWAY OPEN, BUT SEND MORE OF OUR RACE TO STUDY IT AND LIKELY BE DESTROYED IN THE PROCESS?
I HAD MY DOUBTS OF MY CONCLUSION.
THESE ARE NO LONGER.
ADRESSING NEXUS DIRECTLY...YOU ARE COMPROMISED.
YOUR DECISION-MAKING HAS LED TO MINIMAL ADVANCES, YET CAUSED INSURMAUNTABLE DESTRUCTION.
I AM CUTTING OFF ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TERRARIA AND THE NEXUS POST-HASTE
THIS IS THE LAST TRANSMISSION YOU WILL RECEIVE FROM US.
GOODBYE.
