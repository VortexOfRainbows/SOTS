Machine friends, I give you my thanks, as leader of the Lizahrdian race.
Your allience proves to further both of our worlds into new frontiers.
This said, friends, I am afraid I cannot teach you the way of the shamans.
This is not out of malice, nor out of waryness.
Quite the contrary, I would love to show you our ways, but it proves impossible to us.
The methods upon which our people speak with the spiritual is one so ancient, it is lost.
Beyond traditions, only some can speak with spirits, and those who can, are born into this role.
Fret not, machine friends, as regardless of this obstacle, my people will help your cause.
And, should our allience stand strong, under the will of the sun,
we will find a method to attunement, together.
