Brothers and Sisters of the Northern Tribe,
as some of you may have heard, we of the Exploration Effort have found something,
no, someone of unknown and foreign origin to not just us, but Terraria herself.
I write from firsthand account of the encounter,
Out of a fallen sky-spire of metal fell this being, connected with the machine,
it is a machine itself.
Not too dislike our sentinels or our guardians, yet thinking; alive.
It showed us its people, its world, its wish for the interconnection of the stars.
Albeit hesitant, the machine has shown a kinship to us.
It is willing to listen, it can learn,
It yearns to learn.
Communicating remains difficult, yet it has managed to break the language barrier within only a few moons.
We shall be sending the machine friend over to you, should you be willing, so that it may learn more.
I consider the machine a friend, and this friendship a beautiful gift of our sun.
