=============
ADRESSING RECONNESAINCE REPORT...HUMAN SETTLEMENT SITUATED DIRECTLY ABOVE POSSIBLE PORTAL LOCATION.
FURTHER COMMANDS REQUESTED FROM NEXUS...
...COMMANDS RECEIVED...
...PROMPTING PERMISSION TO INQUIRE UPON INSTRUCTIONS...
I FIND IT UNWISE TO ATTEMPT A SECOND ALLIANCE WITH THE HUMAN RACE.
FURTHERMORE, I BELIEVE IT MORE UNWISE TO MAKE OUR INVOLVEMENT MORE PRONOUNCED.
FROM MY CALCULATIONS BASED ON PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS, THERE IS A 47% CHANCE OF DISASTER WERE WE TO INTERACT WITH HUMANS AGAIN.
AND, IF OUR INVOLVEMENT IS TO BE DIRECT AS PER COMMANDED, THERE IS A 72% CHANCE OF DISASTER.
I BELIEVE THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO APROACH THE LAST STEPS OF THE INTERWEAVEMENT PROJECT.
...INQUIRE OVERRULED BY NEXUS...
PROCEEDING WITH COMMANDS.
ALL EARTHEN CONSTRUCTS AND EXCAVATOR, PROCEED TO HUMAN SETTLEMENT FOR FIRST CONTACT IMMEDIATLY.
